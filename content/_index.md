The Garfield musical started out as a febel attempt to make a quick buck. But we quickly realized that we can really capture the essence of Garfield's internal struggle to never truly express himself to his loved ones. Not Only can we give him a chance to show how selfish he can be, but realize the importance of the friends and how to they can help you in the end.
