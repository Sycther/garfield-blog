### Summary

> We started off knowing that we wanted to develop 2 songs to complete the narrative arc for Garfield. One to introduce the tone of the show, while also expressing his absolute love for tasty dish. The other is meant to be deeper as it is suppose to give context to Garfield's lack of connection to Jon and Odie.

Recieved First Draft of script.
 
Plans to make 2 songs to setup and complete narrative arc for Garfield. 
First song will re-introduce the love interest, lasagna, which goes missing by the end of the song. Akin to a sitcom cold open musical number.

First Draft For Lyrics

**OH Lasagna**

```e
    Oh, Odie….. Lasagna isn’t just some old food

    Its the first thought of dawn3
    Its the Last of day-break
    All it’s cheesy sauce
    Really takes  the cake

    When the mornings glum
    and you drank all of your coffee
    just open your fridge
    There you'll find your trophie!

    Have you ever seen such beauty before
    There’s no man nor dog i can love more

    oh that pretty perfect pasta freshly mastered
    COME TO PAPA, YA GALRIOUS BA... (GARFIELD sees missing Lasagna)
```
**Requiem** 
```e
    I thought I held 
    The world in my hand
    But without you
    I cannot stand
    All these lonely days
    Oh, So Cold and frightful
    No more meat-full pasta
    Or sitting idle
    By the fire 
    the tv humming
    The crisp cool air
    dinner in the oven

    Ill always remeber those days
    as im waiting for you

    I'll wait by our window sill
    as im waiting for you
```
