<p>First Draft For Lyrics</p>
<p><strong>OH Lasagna</strong></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-e" data-lang="e">    Oh, Odie….. Lasagna isn’t just some old food

    Its the first thought of dawn
    Its the Last of day-break
    All it’s cheesy sauce
    Really takes the cake


    ***Second verse here***

    Have you ever seen such beauty before
    There’s no man nor dog i can love more
    Then the precious pasta perfectly pasted
    &#34;Come to papa! Ya glorious Ba...&#34;
     (GARFIELD sees missing Lasagna)
</code></pre><p><strong>Requiem</strong></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code class="language-e" data-lang="e">    (A)
    I thought I held 
    The world in my hand
    But without you
    I cannot stand
    (A)
    All these lonely days
    Oh, So Cold and frightful
    No more meat-full pasta
    Or sitting idle
    (A)
    By the fire 
    the tv humming
    The crisp cool air
    dinner in the oven

    
    Wont you come back home



    So I&#39;ll sit by the window
    waiting
    For you to come back home
</code></pre>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Writer's Room</title><link>https://sycther.github.io/garfield-blog/blogs/book/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://sycther.github.io/garfield-blog/blogs/book/</guid><description>jfjfj k
